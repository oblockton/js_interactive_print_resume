# Project Details

 This is an interactive resume, that retains the printability of a typical resume. The projected started as a fork of Udacity's coursework repository. Students were asked to complete the assignment as a final for their Front-End Nanodegree course. Students were provided small foundations upon which they would complete the build. The original details and project Rubrice can be seen in the README of my fork from Udacity: [Udacity Front End Nanodegree](https://github.com/oblockton/frontend-nanodegree-resume).

 Most of my commits and changes were made in above aforementioned repository. Upon reaching a stage of personalization and modification, I have created the new repository for the Web Apps codebase here: [Js_Interactive_Resume](https://github.com/oblockton/js_interactive_print_resume)

 Changes made beyond original project rubric include:
 -Responsiveness
 -Custom CSS framework
 -Active links
 -Modals
 -Layout positions


## Personal requirements for this Project

1. Maintain the ability to print the page, for the purposes of a resume hardcopy.

2. Readability - All relevant information typically included on the resume must be included and restrained to one
   printable page.

3. Page must include interactive functions that do not impede the rendering of important information to
   the printed copy of the page.

4. Interactive functions should maintain a focus on functionality, but also have some consideration for UI.
